# EV Shuttle Grant Strategy for the Grass Valley Farm

## Project Overview

The proposed project involves acquiring an electric commercial van (Chevrolet BrightDrop or equivalent) to serve as:

* A clean, sustainable **airport shuttle** between Grass Valley and Sacramento International Airport (SMF)
* A transport vehicle supporting **agritourism**, **farm-to-table branding**, and **farm operations**
* A rural mobility asset benefiting the community and strengthening local economic activity

This multipurpose approach positions the project to qualify for numerous California and federal grants.

* Provide reliable, low-emission transit between rural Grass Valley and a major transportation hub

### Secondary Uses

* Promote agritourism and local farm brand visibility
* Serve as a mobile ambassador for sustainable agriculture

## Data Still Needed (Simple Questions for Pietro)

1. Approximate mileage from farm to Sacramento Airport (SMF)
2. Estimated round trips per day/week
3. Average passengers per trip
4. Existing EV charging capability on the farm
5. Preferred location for new charging station

7. Any airport contacts or allies
8. Pietro’s one-sentence community benefit description

These can be gathered slowly and comfortably.
