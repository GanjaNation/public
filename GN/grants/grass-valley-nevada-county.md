# GN Grants — Nevada County (Grass Valley) Guide

**Proposed repo path:** `/docs/grants/california/grass-valley-nevada-county.md`

*Last updated: 2025-11-07*

This document summarizes realistic **funding, grants, rebates, and tax credits** to help a small, tourist‑friendly cannabis farm near **Grass Valley (Nevada County, CA)**. It maps PA’s plan (adjacent land, trailers/lodging, eco‑friendly build, tools/solar, grading/capital) to programs that actually exist and typically accept cannabis businesses in California.

> ⚠️ Notes
>
> * Direct **capital grants** to *marijuana* businesses are rare; most federal ag programs exclude marijuana (hemp is different). California local **equity** funds, **energy/storage** rebates, **air-district** equipment grants, **restoration** funding via sponsors, and **tax credits** are the workable lanes.
> * Zoning/licensing rules will determine whether on‑site retail/consumption or tourist lodging is permissible. Grass Valley city is restrictive; unincorporated Nevada County has specific zones and **no on‑site consumption** in current language.

## 2) Energy & Storage (Solar/Batteries)

### SGIP — Self‑Generation Incentive Program (CPUC)

* **What it is:** Rebates for **behind‑the‑meter battery storage**; pair with solar to reduce bills and add resilience (PSPS/fire country). Cannabis facilities are generally **not excluded**.
* **Admin:** Investor‑owned utilities; Grass Valley is **PG&E** territory.
* **Links:**

  * PG&E SGIP (including Equity/Resiliency pathways): [https://www.pge.com/sgip](https://www.pge.com/sgip)

> **Use case:** Lower capex for battery‑backed cold rooms, processing, tasting room power, trailer site power, and demand charge control.

## 3) Equipment & Site Work

### Northern Sierra Air Quality Management District — FARMER Program

* **What it is:** Grants (via CARB) to replace/upgrade **ag equipment** (tractors, ag pumps, certain trucks). Nevada County is in the **Northern Sierra AQMD**.
* **2025 status:** Recent notices indicated **no awards expected in 2025**; check for updates each cycle.

### CDFW — Cannabis Restoration Grant Program (CRGP)

* **What it is:** Funds **restoration/mitigation** (e.g., erosion control, road/stream crossings, water conservation, habitat) via **eligible sponsors** (public agencies/tribes/nonprofits). Private cultivators can benefit on‑site **through a sponsoring partner**.
* **Links:**

  * Program home: [https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Watersheds/Cannabis-Restoration-Grant](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Watersheds/Cannabis-Restoration-Grant)

> **Use case:** If the parcel needs grading, erosion fixes, or water/road work that has ecological benefit, coordinate with a sponsor to pursue CRGP for those elements.

### Compost & Soil Support (General Ag)

* **Zero Foodprint / Compost Connector** sometimes listed by the County; offsets compost costs via restaurant fee pools.
* **Link:** [https://www.zerofoodprint.org/compost-connector](https://www.zerofoodprint.org/compost-connector)

---

## 4) Taxes & Business Relief

### High‑Road Cannabis Tax Credit (HRCTC)

* **What it is:** CA Franchise Tax Board credit equal to **25%** of qualified “high‑road employer” expenditures (e.g., wages, training, benefits), **up to $250,000 per year** (through 2027). Reservation required.
* **Links:**

  * FTB HRCTC: [https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/business/credits/small-business-cannabis-credit.html](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/business/credits/small-business-cannabis-credit.html)

> **Use case:** Material cash‑flow relief as the team hires (≤3 employees now, but credit scales as you add staff and benefits).

---

## 5) Zoning & Licensing Snapshot (Why it Matters for Tourism)

### Grass Valley (City)

* Historically limited to **distribution and nursery** permits; caps/lottery periods applied. On‑site **retail or consumption** not permitted inside city limits.
* **Links:**

  * City Cannabis info: [https://www.cityofgrassvalley.com](https://www.cityofgrassvalley.com) (search: Cannabis, Business, Permits)
  * City ordinance PDF (public consumption generally prohibited): [https://www.cityofgrassvalley.com/sites/g/files/vyhlif9831/f/uploads/chapter_8.06_cannabis_final.pdf](https://www.cityofgrassvalley.com/sites/g/files/vyhlif9831/f/uploads/chapter_8.06_cannabis_final.pdf)

### Unincorporated Nevada County

* County ordinance/summary indicates **specific zones** for commercial cannabis uses, event rules, setbacks, and **no on‑site consumption**. Retail allowances are limited and conditioned (e.g., Nevada‑County‑grown only, and siting often in commercial/industrial zones).
* **Link:**

  * County Cannabis Program (ordinance & summaries): [https://www.nevadacountyca.gov/3431/Cannabis](https://www.nevadacountyca.gov/3431/Cannabis)

> **Implication:** A “tourist farm where visitors buy product and stay in trailers” will likely require: (a) siting **outside** GV city, (b) fitting County zoning, (c) focusing on **nursery/education/tours** without consumption; sales may need to route through a licensed retail premise in an allowed zone or via delivery.

## 6) Mapping PA’s Build to Programs

| Project Element                    | Likely Program                                 | Notes                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Adjacent land purchase             | —                                              | Grants rarely fund private land buys; explore private lending/partners. |
| Trailers / Lodging pads            | SGIP (storage), Utility EE rebates             | Design for battery‑backed power; no on‑site consumption.                |
| Solar + batteries                  | SGIP                                           | Pair with solar; consider Equity/Resiliency if eligible.                |
| Grading / erosion / crossings      | CDFW CRGP (via sponsor)                        | Must show ecological benefit; use a nonprofit/public sponsor.           |
| Tractors / pumps / small equipment | FARMER (Air District)                          | Monitor district; 2025 may be idle, cycles re‑open periodically.        |
| Working capital / fees             | Good to Grow; Nevada City Equity (if eligible) | Small grants; prep compliance docs early.                               |
| Hiring & training                  | HRCTC (tax credit)                             | Reserve credit; build “high‑road” payroll/benefit plan.                 |

## 7) Step‑by‑Step (Next 60–90 Days)

1. **Confirm parcel & jurisdiction** (GV city vs unincorporated county) and zoning fit for intended license type(s).
2. **Sketch an energy design** (solar + storage) and line up an **SGIP** installer to pre‑qualify the rebate tier.
3. **Identify a CRGP sponsor** (local nonprofit/tribe/county) if the site needs restoration‑type work (erosion/road/water). Gather maps/photos.
4. **Assemble compliance package** (state license path, local permits, site plan, budget) so you’re grant‑ready when **Good to Grow** reopens.
5. **Check equity eligibility** (Nevada City) and, if applicable, prep documentation for the next grant window.
6. **Enroll for HRCTC** reservation once hiring plan and payroll/vendor spend are defined.

## 9) Appendix — Assumptions & Caveats

* Information reflects programs as of **Nov 7, 2025**; verify current windows/budgets before committing spend.
* City of Grass Valley retail/consumption restrictions materially affect a “tourist farm” concept; consider siting in unincorporated County or partnering with an allowed retail licensee.
* Federal USDA ag grants (REAP, VAPG, EQIP) generally **exclude marijuana**; hemp may be eligible under different rules.
