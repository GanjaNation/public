# GanjaNation: The First Online Nation

## 1. Mission
GanjaNation is a cooperative network designed to function as a new kind of nation — one that lives both online and on the ground.  
Our mission is to build a community where individuals can collaborate, trade, and grow together through shared principles of fairness, creativity, and sustainability.

## 2. What We’re Building
### Digital Infrastructure
- **Virtual Main Street:** An interactive online hub where members can meet, showcase projects, host shops, and organize events.  
- **Member Tools:** Profiles, communication channels, and community dashboards for transparency and participation.  
- **Economic Layer:** Integration with crypto wallets, GN Coin, and tokenized rewards for contribution and engagement.

### Physical Hubs
- Pilot locations in **Pagosa Springs (CO)**, **Montréal (QC)**, **Andalusia (ES)**, and **Chiang Mai (TH)**.  
- Each hub operates as a cooperative space for cultivation, creative production, and local GN representation.  
- Shared brand standards, locally autonomous operations.

### Governance
- Cooperative model with open membership tiers (*citizen, builder, partner*).  
- Consensus-based decision-making with a lightweight council structure for coordination.  
- Transparent ledgers for budgets, votes, and proposals.

## 3. Core Principles
1. **Sovereignty Through Cooperation** – members own the network collectively.  
2. **Open Source Culture** – knowledge and tools are shared freely inside the nation.  
3. **Sustainability** – regenerative practices in both code and cultivation.  
4. **Fair Exchange** – equal access to opportunity; value measured by contribution.  
5. **Rooted & Real** – online presence must connect to real-world benefit.

## 4. Immediate Goals
- Finalize the **GN Charter** and member code of conduct.  
- Launch **Phase One Main Street prototype** (web + VR).  
- Establish cooperative legal framework (LLC/coop hybrid).  
- Onboard the first 100 founding members.  
- Begin content and product integrations under GN branding.

## 5. Long-Term Vision
A self-sustaining, member-owned ecosystem that blends the best parts of digital collaboration and real-world community building —  
a living example that a nation can be founded on **shared purpose** rather than **geography**.
